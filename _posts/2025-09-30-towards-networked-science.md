I was never consistent with programming until I adopted [Simon Willison's workflow]. Have I produced anything substantial yet? Not really. But I want to participate in the tech blogger sceneâ€”writers like Bruce Schneier, Simon Willison, and George Hotz are the ones I'm following most closely.

The next step is showing others how to follow along, which reminds me of [Terence Tao's crowdsourcing project]. My prediction: as government funding for universities continues to shrink, more academic work will migrate online, leveraging what Yochai Benkler calls "The Wealth of Networks." Top researchers like Tao increasingly need contributions from amateur researchers doing independent work in their free time. Political uncertainty is essentially forcing this shift.
